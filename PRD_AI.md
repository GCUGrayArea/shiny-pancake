## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

**1. AI Feature Response Times (30 points at stake)**
- **Risk:** AI features too slow (>5s), lose points
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement aggressive caching early
  - Use streaming where possible
  - Set realistic timeout expectations
  - Show loading states clearly
  - Test response times continuously

**2. Smart Replies Quality (10 points at stake)**
- **Risk:** Replies don't match user style, not useful
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with simple style analysis
  - Test with real conversation samples
  - Iterate on prompts frequently
  - Get feedback early
  - Have fallback to generic but safe replies

**3. OpenAI Swarm Integration (Technical risk)**
- **Risk:** Swarm harder to use than expected
- **Mitigation:**
  - Set up and test Swarm agent quickly (PR-042)
  - Have fallback to direct OpenAI API calls
  - Document Swarm patterns as you learn
  - Budget extra time for Swarm learning curve

**4. Demo Video Quality (Required deliverable)**
- **Risk:** Demo doesn't show features clearly, loses 15 points
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start demo prep early
  - Do multiple test recordings
  - Budget generous time for editing
  - Have backup recording plan

**5. Time Pressure (84 hours total)**
- **Risk:** Not finishing all required features
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strict prioritization (AI features > stretch goals)
  - Work in parallel where possible (multiple agents)
  - Cut bonus features aggressively if behind
  - Focus on "working > perfect"
