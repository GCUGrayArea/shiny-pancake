**Completion Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** All tasks complete and tested

- Pull-to-refresh
- **Status:** Complete (previous implementation)

### ✅ PR-020: Message Bubble Component
- Send/receive message styling
- Delivery status indicators (sending/sent/delivered/read)
- Timestamp display
- Computed status from message data
- Icon indicators:
  - Sending: Gray single checkmark

  - Read: Darker blue double checkmark
- **Status:** ✅ Complete with status computation

### ✅ PR-021: Conversation Screen
- Message list with FlatList
- Real-time message updates (two listeners):
  - `onChildAdded` for new messages
  - `onChildChanged` for status updates
- Optimistic UI for sent messages
- Auto-scroll to bottom
- Message pagination support
- Delivery tracking (marks received messages as delivered)
- Read receipt tracking (marks visible messages as read)
- Viewability tracking (50% visible for 500ms)
- **Status:** ✅ Complete with full status tracking

### ✅ PR-022: Message Input Component
- Auto-growing text input
- Character count (1000 max)
- Send button with loading state
- Message queue integration
- Offline handling
- **Status:** Complete (previous implementation)

## Additional Implementations (Block 7 Enhancement)

### Message Status Computation System
**File:** `src/utils/message-status.utils.ts`

Implemented computed status approach:
- Status derived from message data (Firebase ID, deliveredTo, readBy arrays)
- Eliminates need for manual status field updates
- Single source of truth (Firebase data)
- Helper functions for all status checks

### Firebase Real-time Status Updates
**File:** `src/services/firebase-message.service.ts`

Added `subscribeToMessageUpdates()`:
- Uses `onChildChanged` listener
- Receives status updates in real-time
- Sender sees delivery/read status updates immediately
- Debounced updates to reduce Firebase writes

### Delivery and Read Receipt Tracking
**Files:** 
- `src/screens/ConversationScreen.tsx`
- `src/services/firebase-message.service.ts`
- `src/services/local-message.service.ts`

Features:
- Automatic delivery marking when messages load
- Read receipt marking based on viewport visibility
- Group chat support (shows delivered/read when ANY participant has done so)
- Deduplication (doesn't re-mark same user)
- Firebase sync with local database

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests ✅
**File:** `src/__tests__/message-status.utils.test.ts`
- 50 tests, all passing
- Complete coverage of status computation logic
- Edge case handling
- Group chat scenarios

### Integration Tests ✅
**File:** `src/__tests__/integration/message-delivery-status.integration.test.ts`
- Complete status progression testing
- Delivery tracking (single and multiple recipients)
- Read receipt tracking
- Real-time updates via Firebase listeners
- Edge cases and group chat scenarios

## Key Features Delivered

1. **Complete Message Lifecycle:**
   - sending → sent → delivered → read
   - Visual feedback at every stage
   - Real-time status updates

2. **Delivery Tracking:**
   - Tracks which users received messages
   - Works for 1:1 and group chats
   - Firebase-backed with local cache

3. **Read Receipts:**
   - Automatic when message is viewed
   - Viewport-based detection
   - Deduplication built-in

4. **Optimistic UI:**
   - Messages appear instantly
   - Smooth status transitions
   - Handles offline scenarios

5. **Real-time Sync:**
   - Two-listener approach (new messages + updates)
   - Sender sees status changes immediately
   - No polling required

## Technical Achievements

1. **Computed Status Pattern:**
   - Status calculated from data, not stored
   - More reliable than stored status
   - Single source of truth (Firebase)

2. **Efficient Firebase Usage:**
   - Debounced status updates (500ms)
   - Separate listeners for adds vs changes
   - Minimal duplicate operations

3. **Robust Offline Support:**
   - Messages queue when offline
   - Status updates when connection restored
   - No message loss

4. **Scalable Architecture:**
   - Ready for group chat enhancements
   - Supports detailed per-user tracking (future)
   - Clean separation of concerns

## Documentation

- ✅ `BLOCK7_DELIVERED_READ_STATUS.md` - Detailed implementation notes
- ✅ `PRD_MVP.md` - Updated with out-of-scope items
- ✅ Inline code comments
- ✅ Test documentation

## Known Limitations (By Design)

1. Detailed per-user delivery/read tracking UI not implemented (out of scope for MVP)
2. Status updates require network connection (Firebase dependency)
3. Read receipts require 50% visibility for 500ms (prevents false positives)

## Manual Testing Completed

- ✅ 1:1 message flow (sending → sent → delivered → read)
- ✅ Offline message queueing and status progression
- ✅ Multiple rapid messages with correct status
- ✅ Real-time status updates between users
- ✅ Optimistic UI behavior
- ✅ Message persistence across app restarts

## Dependencies Met

- Firebase Realtime Database with `onChildChanged` listener
- React Native FlatList viewability tracking
- Expo SQLite for local persistence
- Message queue infrastructure (Block 5)

## Ready for Production

Block 7 is complete and ready for production use. All core messaging UI components are implemented with full delivery and read status tracking. The system is tested, documented, and handles both online and offline scenarios gracefully.

## Next Steps

- Block 8: Image Handling (PR-023, PR-024)
- Block 9: Group Chat (PR-025, PR-026, PR-027, PR-028)
- Block 10: Push Notifications (PR-029, PR-030, PR-031)
