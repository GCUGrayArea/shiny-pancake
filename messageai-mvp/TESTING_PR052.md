# PR-052: Background/Killed Push Notifications - Manual Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for manually testing the FCM-based push notification system, including background and killed state scenarios.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: These tests MUST be performed on physical devices, not emulators. Push notifications do not work reliably in emulators.

## Prerequisites

### Required Setup
1. **Two Physical Devices** (for best testing):
   - Device A: Primary test device (iOS or Android)
   - Device B: Secondary device to send messages (can be another phone or use Expo Go on computer)

2. **Firebase Project Configuration**:
   - Ensure Firebase Cloud Functions are deployed: `cd functions && npm run deploy`
   - Verify Firebase RTDB rules are updated
   - Check that `google-services.json` (Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) is in place

3. **Expo Project ID**:
   - Update `notification.service.ts` line 205 with your actual Expo project ID
   - Find it in `app.json` or Expo dashboard

4. **App Installation**:
   - Install app via Expo Go OR build a standalone APK/IPA
   - For production testing, standalone builds are recommended

## Test Suite

### Test 1: Initial Setup & Token Registration

**Objective**: Verify push token is registered when app starts

**Steps**:
1. Fresh install the app on Device A
2. Sign up or log in with a test account
3. Grant notification permissions when prompted
4. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Realtime Database ‚Üí `/users/{userId}`
5. Verify `pushToken` field exists and contains a token string

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Notification permission granted
- ‚úÖ Push token saved to user profile in Firebase
- ‚úÖ No errors in console

**Troubleshooting**:
- If no token: Check notification permissions in device settings
- If token not saved: Check Firebase rules allow write to `pushToken`

### Test 2: Foreground Notifications

**Objective**: Verify notifications appear when app is open

**Steps**:
1. Open app on Device A, navigate to chat list (not in a conversation)
2. From Device B, send a message to Device A's account
3. Observe notification behavior on Device A

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Notification banner appears at top of screen
- ‚úÖ Sound plays (if not silenced)
- ‚úÖ Notification shows correct sender name and message preview
- ‚úÖ Tapping notification navigates to the correct chat

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

---

### Test 3: Background Notifications

**Steps**:
1. Open app on Device A, then press Home button (app moves to background)
2. From Device B, send a message to Device A's account
3. Wait 2-3 seconds
4. Observe notification on Device A
5. Tap the notification
6. Verify app opens to the correct chat

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Notification appears while app is in background
- ‚úÖ Notification shows correct content (sender, message preview)
- ‚úÖ Badge count on app icon shows correct unread count
- ‚úÖ Tapping notification brings app to foreground
- ‚úÖ App navigates directly to the chat that sent the message
- ‚úÖ Message is visible in the conversation

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

---

### Test 4: Killed State Notifications (Critical Test)

**Objective**: Verify notifications work when app is completely closed

**Steps**:
1. On Device A, force quit the app:
   - iOS: Swipe up from bottom, swipe app up to close
   - Android: Recent apps ‚Üí swipe app away OR Settings ‚Üí Force Stop
2. Verify app is completely closed (not in recent apps)
3. From Device B, send a message to Device A's account
4. Wait 3-5 seconds
5. Observe notification on Device A (app should still be closed)
6. Tap the notification
7. Observe app launch and navigation behavior

**Expected Result**:
- ‚úÖ Notification appears even though app was completely closed
- ‚úÖ Notification content is correct (sender name, message preview)
- ‚úÖ Badge count shows correct unread count
- ‚úÖ Tapping notification launches the app
- ‚úÖ App performs cold start successfully
- ‚úÖ App automatically navigates to the correct chat

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Android
- **Channel ID**: Ensure "messages" channel is created (handled by code)
- **Sound**: Check notification channel settings in device settings
- **Battery Optimization**: May need to disable battery optimization for the app
- **Permissions**: Notification permission required for Android 13+

### iOS
- **Background Modes**: Enabled in `app.json` - "remote-notification"
- **Certificates**: Ensure APNS certificates are valid (if using standalone build)
- **Silent Updates**: Content-available flag enables background updates
- **Badge Count**: Managed by APNS payload

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Notifications Not Appearing

**Check**:
1. ‚úÖ Notification permissions granted in device settings
2. ‚úÖ Push token exists in Firebase user profile
3. ‚úÖ Cloud Function deployed successfully
4. ‚úÖ Cloud Function logs show no errors
5. ‚úÖ Device has internet connection
6. ‚úÖ App has correct Firebase configuration files

**Common Issues**:
- **Expo Go**: Limited background notification support - use standalone build
- **Invalid Token**: Check token format in Firebase
- **Network Issues**: Ensure FCM can reach device
- **Rules Error**: Verify Firebase Database rules allow token writes

### Deep Linking Not Working

**Check**:
1. ‚úÖ Notification data includes `chatId`
2. ‚úÖ `handleNotificationResponse` function is called
3. ‚úÖ Navigation handler is set in AppNavigator
4. ‚úÖ Chat exists and user is a participant

### Unread Counts Incorrect

**Check**:
1. ‚úÖ Cloud Function increments unread count
2. ‚úÖ `markChatAsRead` is called when chat is opened
3. ‚úÖ Firebase rules allow reading/writing unread counts
4. ‚úÖ Subscription to unread counts is active
