# Block 10: Notification Bug Fixes

## Issues Found During Testing & Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ Bug 1: "Unknown" Display Name When Opening from Notification
**Status**: FIXED

**Issue**: When opening a chat from a notification, the other user's display name showed as "Unknown" in the header. Navigating back to chat list and reopening fixed it.

**Root Cause**: When opening from notification, we only pass `chatId` in route params, not the other user's info. The screen didn't load user data when opening from notification.

**Fix**: Added logic to `ConversationScreen.tsx`:
1. Added `loadedOtherUserName` state
2. Created useEffect to load other user's info from chat when `otherUserName` is not provided
3. Updated header title logic to use `loadedOtherUserName` as fallback
4. User info now loads automatically when opening from notification

**Files Changed**:
- `src/screens/ConversationScreen.tsx` (lines 54, 69-96, 140, 174)

### ‚úÖ Bug 2: No Auto-Scroll When Opening from Notification
**Status**: FIXED

**Issue**: When tapping a notification to open a chat, the user had to manually scroll down to see the new message that triggered the notification.

**Root Cause**: No auto-scroll logic when opening chat from notification.

**Fix**: Added auto-scroll logic to `ConversationScreen.tsx`:
1. Added `flatListRef` using `useRef<FlatList>(null)`
2. Added `scrollToEnd()` call after messages load
3. 300ms delay ensures messages are rendered before scrolling
4. Smooth animated scroll to bottom

**Files Changed**:
- `src/screens/ConversationScreen.tsx` (lines 8, 55, 180-184, 673)

### ‚úÖ Bug 3: Chat With Self Prevention
**Status**: FIXED (as prevention - see feature request below)

**Issue**: Trying to start a chat with yourself opened an existing test chat instead of being blocked.

**Root Cause**: No validation to prevent users from selecting themselves in the user list.

**Fix**: Added prevention logic to `NewChatScreen.tsx`:
1. Filter out current user from user list entirely
2. Added explicit check in `handleUserSelect` to prevent selection
3. Console log warns if somehow attempted

**Feature Request**: "Note to Self" functionality (like Signal) would be useful but is out of MVP scope.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/screens/NewChatScreen.tsx` (lines 56, 212-216)

---

### ‚úÖ Bug 4: Historical Message Notifications on Login
**Status**: FIXED

**Issue**: On login, user receives notifications for ALL historical messages that were sent while logged out, causing notification spam.

**Root Cause**: Notification manager didn't differentiate between historical messages (during initial sync) and new real-time messages.

**Fix**: Added login timestamp tracking to `notification-manager.service.ts`:
1. Record timestamp when user logs in
2. Add 5-second buffer for clock skew tolerance
3. Only show notifications for messages with timestamp > login time
4. Historical messages suppressed with console log

**Files Changed**:
- `src/services/notification-manager.service.ts` (lines 15, 31-42, 55-60)

---

### ‚úÖ Bug 5: "Unknown" Display Name (Second Fix)
**Status**: FIXED

**Issue**: Display name still showed as "Unknown" when opening chat from notification, even after first fix.

**Root Cause**: Navigation from notification only passed `chatId`, not the sender information that was available in the notification payload.

**Fix**: Updated notification navigation flow:
1. Pass full notification data (including `senderName`) to navigation handler
2. AppNavigator now passes `otherUserName` from notification data
3. Falls back to loading from Firebase if name not in notification
4. Provides immediate display name from notification for better UX

**Files Changed**:
- `src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx` (lines 23, 25, 81)
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` (lines 97-105)

## Feature Requests (Out of MVP Scope)

### FR-1: "Note to Self" Chat
**Status**: FEATURE REQUEST (Nice to Have)

**Description**: Ability to send messages to yourself, similar to Signal's "Note to Self" feature.

**Use Cases**:
- Quick notes and reminders
- Transferring links/text between devices
- Testing message features

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Would require special handling in chat creation
- Need UI indicator that it's a self-chat
- Notifications should probably be suppressed
- Estimated: 2-3 hours

## Known Issues (Out of Scope for Block 10)

### Issue 6: Duplicate Messages (Rapid Sending)
**Status**: OUT OF SCOPE (Block 7 - Message Queue)

**Issue**: Rapid sending of multiple messages sometimes produces duplicates:
- Example: Sending 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 resulted in 1 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 5
- Affects both notifications AND persisted chat
- Likely related to message deduplication logic in Block 7

**Recommendation**: 
- Mark as post-MVP bug to investigate
- May be related to Firebase RTDB listener behavior
- Could be Expo Go emulation issue
- Not blocking MVP (affects rare edge case of very rapid sends)

---

### Issue 7: Pull-to-Refresh at Wrong End
**Status**: OUT OF SCOPE (UI Polish)

**Issue**: Pull-to-refresh activates at top of chat (where older messages are) instead of bottom.

**Recommendation**:
- Minor UX improvement for post-MVP
- Standard chat UI pattern is pull-to-refresh at top for older messages
- Not blocking MVP functionality
