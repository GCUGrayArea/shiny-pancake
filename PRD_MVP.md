# Product Requirements Document: MessageAI MVP
## Cross-Platform Messaging App with Real-Time Sync

**Version:** 1.0 MVP  
**Target Persona:** International Communicator  
**Timeline:** 24 hours  
**Last Updated:** October 20, 2025

## Executive Summary

MessageAI MVP is a production-quality messaging application built for the International Communicator persona—people with friends, family, and colleagues speaking different languages. The MVP focuses exclusively on core messaging infrastructure: real-time message delivery, offline support, message persistence, and basic group chat functionality.

This is an AI-driven development project with no human-generated code. The MVP serves as a foundation for future AI-powered features including real-time translation, language detection, and cultural context assistance.

  /services         # API, Firebase, storage services
  /hooks            # Custom React hooks
  /utils            # Pure utility functions
  /contexts         # React contexts (Auth, Theme, etc.)
  /types            # TypeScript interfaces/types
  /constants        # App constants
  /__tests__        # Unit tests mirroring source structure
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Real-time sync complexity** - Multiple device states, network conditions
   - *Mitigation:* Use Firebase RTDB's built-in sync, extensive testing
   
2. **Message ordering/delivery guarantees** - Race conditions, offline scenarios
   - *Mitigation:* Timestamp-based ordering, message queue with retry logic

3. **AI code generation consistency** - Maintaining architecture across multiple prompts
   - *Mitigation:* Clear PRD, frequent validation checkpoints, strict file size limits

### Medium Risk
1. **Push notification configuration** - FCM setup can be complex
   - *Mitigation:* Follow Expo FCM documentation precisely, test early

2. **Group chat complexity** - Delivery tracking per participant
   - *Mitigation:* Start simple (3 users), extend carefully

3. **Image upload performance** - Large images, slow networks
   - *Mitigation:* Compression before upload, clear progress indicators

### Low Risk
1. **Firebase quota limits** - Free tier may have restrictions
   - *Mitigation:* User has Firebase credits, optimize queries

2. **Expo Go limitations** - Some features may need custom dev client
   - *Mitigation:* Design within Expo Go constraints, document workarounds

## Appendix: AI Prompting Strategy

### Suggested Development Flow
1. **Start with data models** - Define TypeScript interfaces first
2. **Build authentication** - Get login/logout working before anything else
3. **Implement basic messaging** - 1:1 text only, no optimizations
4. **Add persistence** - SQLite integration
5. **Add real-time sync** - Firebase RTDB listeners
6. **Implement offline queue** - Message retry logic
7. **Add optimistic UI** - Instant message display
8. **Extend to group chat** - Reuse 1:1 logic
9. **Add images** - Upload/download/display
10. **Polish UI** - Chat list, navigation, status indicators
11. **Implement notifications** - FCM setup
12. **Test & validate** - Run all scenarios

### Key Prompts for AI Tools
- "Create a TypeScript interface for a chat message with delivery states"
- "Implement a message queue service with offline support and retry logic, max 75 lines per function"
- "Write unit tests for message delivery state transitions"
- "Create a React Native component for displaying messages with delivery status, under 200 lines"
- "Implement Firebase RTDB listener for real-time message sync, handle disconnections"
- "Generate Firebase Security Rules for multi-participant chat access control"
